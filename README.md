## Road Accident Dashboard

This project involves analyzing road accident data using Tableau. The goal is to uncover insights regarding accident occurrences, casualties, and contributing factors. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends to aid in understanding and addressing road safety issues.

### Key Metrics and Visualizations

1. **Total Accidents**
    - Displays the annual trends in the number of road accidents and compares the current year with the previous year.

2. **Total Casualties**
    - Shows the annual trends in the total number of casualties resulting from road accidents, with a year-over-year comparison.

3. **Fatal Casualties**
    - Illustrates the trends in fatal casualties over the year and compares with the previous year.

4. **Serious Casualties**
    - Highlights the annual trends in serious casualties with a year-over-year comparison.

5. **Slight Casualties**
    - Depicts the trends in slight casualties throughout the year and compares with the previous year.

6. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**
    - Breakdown of casualties by different types of vehicles such as cars, bicycles, trucks, and more.

7. **Casualties by Weather Conditions**
    - Pie chart showing the distribution of casualties based on weather conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., fine, rain, snow/fog).

8. **Casualties by Road Surface Type**
    - Distribution of casualties based on the type of road surface at the time of the accident (e.g., dry, wet, frost).

9. **Casualties by Road Type**
    - Breakdown of casualties by different types of roads (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout).

10. **Casualties by Districts**
    - Geographical distribution of casualties across different districts, visualized on a map.

### Insights

- **Accident Trends**: There is a noticeable decrease in total accidents and casualties compared to the previous year.
- **Vehicle Type Impact**: Cars are involved in the majority of casualties, while other vehicles like bicycles and trucks have significantly fewer casualties.
- **Weather Conditions**: Most accidents occur under fine weather conditions, followed by rain.
- **Road Surface Conditions**: Accidents are most frequent on dry surfaces, with a significant number also occurring on wet surfaces.
- **Geographical Distribution**: The map visualization helps identify districts with higher accident rates, aiding in targeted safety measures.

### Using the Tableau Dashboard

1. **Opening the Dashboard**:
    - Ensure you have Tableau installed.
    - Open the `Road_Accident_Dashboard.twbx` file with Tableau.

2. **Exploring the Data**:
    - Interact with the charts to explore different aspects of the accident data.
    - Use filters to drill down into specific vehicle types, weather conditions, road surfaces, or districts.

### Conclusion

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of road accidents and casualties. By identifying key trends and areas of concern, it can help policymakers and safety authorities formulate strategies to improve road safety and reduce accidents.
